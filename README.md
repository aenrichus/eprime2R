# eprime2R

This file is intended as an example of how to read and clean the output of experiments designed in E-Prime into R for statistical analysis. Perhaps the most important point is that you need to output for Statview/SPSS with the Unicode box unchecked in E-Prime. This will allow you to read the delimited text file into R successfully.

While E-Prime is slowly being replaced by PsychoPy for implementing psychological experimental design, this should help in using what is becoming legacy software with R.
